# NYC-School-Visualization
Choropleth of many demographic aspects of New York City's school districts. 

The dataset came from New York City's [Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) website, particularly [this](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-District/m2z7-dx25) page.
